  * You can perform the Laplace transformation on a resistor, inductor, and capacitor when given initial conditions.
  * You can find solutions of LTI differential equations with initial conditions using Laplace and inverse Laplace. 
  * You can perform circuit analysis when initial conditions of capacitors and inductors are given.
